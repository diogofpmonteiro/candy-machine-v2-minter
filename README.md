# Candy-Machine-Mint

The Candy-Machine-Mint project is designed to let users fork, customize, and deploy their own candy machine mint app to a custom domain, ultra fast.

A candy machine is an on-chain Solana program (or smart contract) for managing fair mint. Fair mints:

- Start and finish at the same time for everyone.
- Won't accept your funds if they're out of NFTs to sell.

The Candy-Machine-Mint project is meant to be as simple and usable as possible, accessible to everyone from long-time crypto devs to junior React devs with a vague interest in NFTs. Our goal is to empower users to create their own front ends to display, sell, and manage their NFTs as simply as possible by just updating a few styled components and following a well-documented process for setup and shipping.

In this project my main achievements were:

- Getting familiar with TypeScript
- Generate the metadata for the NFT collection using the hashlips art generator
- Deploy my own algorithmically generated NFT collection on the solana blockchain (devnet) using Metaplex
- Create a small react app where users can mint their NFTs.
